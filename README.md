# Work summary

## (2025) Doctoral research, Jadavpur University

---

**2024** I teach Machine Learning as a Teaching Assistant with IIT Madras. 

**2023** I group the sum of my pursuits in 2023 as an year in AI, as my studies were focused in classical machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning. 

**2023** My internship report represents my initial effort at pulling together research directions in deep learning, linguistics and Sanskrit NLP. My work centred on collecting inputs for a linguistically informed pre-training objective for Sanskrit LLMs. I propose directions for further research e.g. the theories of meaning in the Indic tradition of the philosophy of language. 

**2019-22** Previously in my Master's thesis (unpublished), I forwarded propositions on some various aspects: language and economics, language evolution, and language pedagogy.
